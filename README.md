  * LocalStorage to presist data
  * Iterate through/filter DOM elements using (for) loops.
  * Understand the difference btween the data model and how the date is displayed on the. DOM.
  * Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX.

  * The site is a useful tool for people who would like to organize their tasks and be able to track their progress on completing those tasks.
  * The user can create a task by entering a title and task item(s) and clicking "Make Task List."
  * Make a mistake? No problem. Users can delete tasks on the left side as needed.
  * Then, the card will appear on the right side of the screen.
  * Users can then check off their tasks as they complete them and delete the card (only if you finished all of the tasks!).
  * If a to do list is urgent, users can mark it as such by clicking the lightning bolt. 
  * Need to leave and come back? You can refresh the page and your tasks will still be there!
